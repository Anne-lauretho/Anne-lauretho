## My projects (chronological order)

**ProjectBikeTeam7**  
During my first year of master’s, I worked in a team project to analyze and visualize bike usage data in Montpellier. We developed an interactive tool that provided insights on urban mobility and cycling trends.  

**Takuzu on R Shiny**  
As part of my coursework, I collaborated on building a Takuzu game with R Shiny. I contributed to the game logic as well as the interactive interface, combining statistics, programming, and creativity.  

**Pl@ntNet – Conformal Prediction**  
One of the most challenging and enriching projects I worked on! With my team, we explored the Pl@ntNet-CrowdSWE database and applied conformal prediction techniques to improve the identification of plant species.

**ANR ACACIA – Internship (CEFE-CNRS & LIREDF)**   
During a 2-month internship, I worked on the educational aspect of the ANR ACACIA project.  
- Performed quantitative analysis on survey data collected from students.  
- Conducted data preparation and cleaning.  
- Proposed methodological approaches for statistical analysis.  
- Developed R scripts to analyze and visualize results.
